The updated TXSS models for macsyfinder2+
------

TXSSscan is a database for identification of secretion systems in gram-negative bacteria and different kinds of secretion system can be detected with macsyfinder. With the update of mascyfinder from 1.0 to 2.0, the models for each secretion system created for v1 are no longer compatable with v2. The tutorial on how to carry model v1 to v2 can be found here: https://macsyfinder.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/.

For convenience, I updated the models for all secretion systems (TXSS) and you can download the repo to anywhere you want and carry on your journey with macsyfinder2.0.
